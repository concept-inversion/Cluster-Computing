# Threaded_SC
This is a architecture for Distributed Cluster Computing for dividing a task , computing them in different computers in network and adding them at last.
 With the advancement of new technologies , computer are getting faster but there is a limit. So , for achieving high performance computing we can use multiple cheap computers to perform a single task. From this we can obtain parallelism in the task and can achieve supercomputing power.
